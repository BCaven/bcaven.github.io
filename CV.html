    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Lead Software Engineer at Notre Dame Studios: Summer 2025 - present</h3>
    <p>I pitched and built a virtual production studio using UE5 from the ground up. I also presented it as proof-of-concept to the Office of Digital Learning and the Acting Vice President for Academic and Community Technology Experience at Notre Dame.<br>
    I also created custom plugins for UE5 in C++ to run machine learning models using Blueprints and to utilize libtorch to process incoming video frames in real time with minimal latency.</p>

    <h3>Researcher in <a href="https://github.com/gessLab">GESS Lab</a>: Spring 2025 - present</h3>
    <p>Developed real-time simulations in C++ under Professor Dan Rehberg. My first project was developing an in-texture physics system and the second was using computer vision models in real time to enhance the interactivity of 3D scenes.</p>

    <h3>Graduate Teaching Assistant: Fall 2025</h3>
    <p>Served as Graduate Teaching Assistant under Professor Dan Rehberg for Game Development (CSE 40439). Assisted students learning introduction concepts in Godot. Taught two guest lectures: one on <em>alternative uses of game engines</em> and another on <em>best practices in Godot</em>.</p>

    <h3>On-Campus Intern at CDW: Fall 2024 - present</h3>
    <p>Worked for CDW Corp's government business, providing subject matter expertise and on-campus technical sale support as part of CDW's account team serving the University of Notre Dame to provide custom solutions for the University's IT strategy. I worked closely with Athletics, the Center for Research Computing, and the Office of Information Technology.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Assistant: Spring 2025</h3>

    <p>Researched under Dr. Krushe and Dr. Wang in DHARMA. Part of multi-disciplinary team of Computer Science and Architecture researchers that completed a digital restoration of the Roman Forum and created a sea level rise visualization using ArcGIS to predict where future problems will occur. I am co-author on <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10399514">Visualizing Digital Architectural Data for Heritage Education</a>.</p>

    <h3>Assistant Tennis Coach at JTCC Bolles: Summer 2023</h3>

    <h2>Projects and Competitions</h2>
    <p>A complete list of my personal projects can be found at <a href="https://github.com/BCaven/">https://github.com/BCaven/</a> but these are my favorites.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/BCaven/multiplayer-game-server">Multiplayer Game Server</a>: Fall 2024</h3>
    <p>Distributed Systems Architecture: server cluster with sequential consistency that dynamically created and removed servers to match server load. Tested with up to 256 simultaneous clients. Average latency of 0.075 seconds with 256 connected clients.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/BCaven/elgato-light-controller">Elgato Light Strip Controller</a>: Fall 2023</h3>
    <p>Network orchestration for IOT devices: Controller that autonomously controlled Elgato Light Strips using the reverse engineered API. This controller has been running continuously since December 2023. In 2024 the project got redone to be more pythonic and I used an LLM to automatically apply changes across the program (such as replacing a custom logging module with the built-in python <code>logging</code> module).</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/BCaven/creativity-optional">Creativity Optional</a>: Spring 2024</h3>
    <p>Real-time Streaming Processor: Lead developer for OSS that allows the user to send arbitrary real-time data to a custom 3D scene. Built using Flask and ThreeJS.</p>
