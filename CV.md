# Projects and Competitions:

> A complete list of my personal projects can be found at https://github.com/BCaven/ but these are my favorites.

## [Multiplayer Game Server](https://github.com/BCaven/multiplayer-game-server): Fall 2024

Distributed Systems Architecture: server cluster with sequential consistency that dynamically created and removed servers to match server load. \
Tested with up to 256 simultaneous clients. Average latency of 0.075 seconds with 256 connected clients.

## [Elgato Light Strip Controller](https://github.com/BCaven/elgato-light-controller): Fall 2023

Network orchestration for IOT devices: Controller that autonomously controlled Elgato Light Strips using the reverse engineered API.\
This controller has been running continuously since December 2023. In 2024 the project got redone to be more pythonic and I used an LLM to automatically apply changes across the program (such as replacing a custom logging module with the built-in python `logging` module).

## [Creativity Optional](https://github.com/BCaven/creativity-optional): Spring 2024

Real-time Streaming Processor: Lead developer for OSS that allows the user to send arbitrary real-time data to a custom 3D scene. \
Built using Flask and ThreeJS.

## Innovate-o-thon: Fall 2021, Spring 2022

Engineering Innovate-o-thon at University of Notre Dame hosted by Marmon Industries. \
I led my team to the top prize of $2,000 in the Fall 2021 competition and the Spring 2022 competition.
