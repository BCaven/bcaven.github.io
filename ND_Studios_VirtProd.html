    <h1>Virtual Production at Notre Dame Studios</h1>

    <h2>Lead Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>Pitched and built an on-set virtual production studio from the ground up using UE5. I periodically presented live demonstrations of the system to the Office of Digital Learning and the Acting Vice President for Academic and Community Technology Experience at Notre Dame.</p>

    <p>Implemented a real-time machine learning pipeline directly integrated into UE5 with a blueprint wrapper library for non-technical users. Also designed and built a real-time machine learning pipeline using Blackmagic Design's Decklink capture and playback cards and Libtorch to offload heavier models with a 3.34x performance improvement before optimization.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> C++, UE5, Blueprints, Libtorch, Decklink, OpenCV</p>

    <p>Coordinated a small team building technical and artistic components in UE5.</p>
