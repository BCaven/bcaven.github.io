## [Multiplayer Game Server](https://github.com/BCaven/multiplayer-game-server): Fall 2024

Distributed Systems Architecture: server cluster with sequential consistency that dynamically created and removed servers to match server load. \
Tested with up to 256 simultaneous clients. Average latency of 0.075 seconds with 256 connected clients.

## [Elgato Light Strip Controller](https://github.com/BCaven/elgato-light-controller): Fall 2023 - present

Network orchestration for IOT devices: Controller that autonomously controlled Elgato Light Strips using the reverse engineered API.\
This controller has been running continuously since December 2023. In 2024 the project got redone to be more pythonic and I used an LLM to automatically apply changes across the program (such as replacing a custom logging module with the built-in python `logging` module.

## [Creativity Optional](https://github.com/BCaven/creativity-optional): Spring 2024 - present

Real-time Streaming Processor: Lead developer for OSS that allows the user to send arbitrary real-time data to a custom 3D scene. \
